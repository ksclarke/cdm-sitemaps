cdm-sitemaps (version 0.0.1)            https://github.com/ksclarke/cdm-sitemaps


================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This is a PHP script that will generate sitemaps for each collection in a
ContentDM instance.  It also creates a sitemap index that references the
sitemaps of the publicly available collections.  Run nightly, it will create
static files that a search engine's spider can then use to learn about about
your ContentDM's collections.

Optionally, it will also create sitemaps for collections that are not publicly
available.  These sitemaps will not be referenced from the sitemap index though.

What good is this?  Having these sitemaps available (if you know where to find
them) allows scripts, able to authenticate with ContentDM, to have a simple way
to learn about what has changed or been added to a private ContentDM collection.

For this to work, you have to create a read-only ContentDM account and put the
username and password in cdm-sitemaps' configuration file.  Even if you don't
use this option, you still need to put the location of your ContentDM instance
in the cdm-sitemaps' configuration file.

HOSTED CONTENTDM INSTANCES
================================================================================

Seems we're okay with execution time and RAM usage... now we just need to know
where we'll put this file once they release 6.1.  Update this section once the
new CDM version is released.

UPDATE: This script won't work with hosted ContentDM instances.  Recent updates
now prevent users from uploading files to the file system (needed for placement
of the sitemap files) and also prevent authenticated access to the API (even if
you are authenticated, it won't show you private collections).


================================================================================
INSTALLATION
================================================================================

You can check out the project from Github or download the latest release from
the Github project home page (on the top, right side of the screen).

To find the project on Github, go to:

   https://github.com/ksclarke/cdm-sitemaps

Once you've downloaded the project, empty its contents into the root directory
of your ContentDM installation.  You will want to create a cron job that hits
the build.php file periodically (and you might want to block general access to
that too).

You probably will want to change the timezone setting in the .htaccess file.
